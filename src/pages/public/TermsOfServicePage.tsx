            <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">General Payment Terms</span>. Certain
            features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will
            have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless
            otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are
            non-refundable, except as required by law. The pricing and payment terms in this Section
            4 are subject to any pricing and payment terms set forth in an Order Form.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.1. <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Price</span>. Aquila Labs reserves
            the right to determine pricing for the Service. Aquila Labs will make reasonable efforts
            to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to
            check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. Aquila Labs may
            change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if
            Aquila Labs gives you advance notice of changes before they apply through the Service
            user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means. Your
            continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your
            agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be responsible for all taxes associated
            with the Service, other than taxes based on Aquila Labs' net income. Aquila Labs, at its
            sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different
            pricing to any of Aquila Labs' customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you,
            will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

            4.2. <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Payment Processing</span>.
            Notwithstanding any amounts owed to Aquila Labs hereunder, <br />
            AQUILA LABS DOES NOT DIRECTLY PROCESS PAYMENT FOR ANY SERVICES. To facilitate payment
            for the Service via bank account, credit card, or debit card, we use Stripe, Inc. and
            its affiliates (“<span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Stripe</span>”), a
            third-party payment processor. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe
            and are subject to the Stripe terms and conditions and other policies available at{' '}
            <a href="https://stripe.com/legal" className="text-black underline">

            (collectively, the “
            <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Stripe Agreements</span>”). By agreeing to
            these Terms, users that use the payment functions of the Service also agree to be bound
            by the Stripe Agreements, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. You
            hereby authorize Stripe to store and continue billing your specified payment method even
            after such payment method has expired, to avoid interruptions in payment for your use of
            the Service. Please contact Stripe for more information. Aquila Labs assumes no
            liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.3. <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Subscription Service</span>. The
            Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring
            payments for periodic charges (“
            <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Subscription Service</span>”). The “
            <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Subscription Billing Date</span>” is the
            date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service
            will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period
            that you select on your account (such period, the “
            <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Initial Subscription Period</span>”), and
            will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial
            Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each
            a “<span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Subscription Period</span>”) unless you
            cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription
            Service, then you authorize Aquila Labs or its third-party payment processors to
            periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription
            Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. For information on the “
            <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Subscription Fee</span>”, please see our
            pricing page. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing
            Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable
            fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription
            Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee
            to your account. Aquila Labs or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic
            Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you
            otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by using the
            cancellation functionality made available in your billing menu or by contacting us at{' '}
            <a href="mailto:boris@superflex.ai" className="text-black underline">

              boris@superflex.ai
            </a>
            . YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE
            FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.

          <p>
            4.4. <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Delinquent Accounts</span>. Aquila
            Labs may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the
            Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the
            amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges
            that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including
            collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal
            Subscription Fee is due, then Aquila Labs reserves the right to delete your account and
            any information associated with your account without any liability to you.

            (collectively, “<span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Suggestions</span>”).
            Aquila Labs hereby assigns to you all of our right, title, and interest in and to any
            Suggestions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that Suggestions are
            generated automatically by machine learning technology and may be similar to or the same

            provided, or returned by the Service for or to other customers are granted to you under

            with respect to Suggestions provided by large language and other AI models (each an “AI
            Model”) due to the fact that it is automatically generated, including that (a) it may
            contain errors or misleading information, (b) AI Models are based on predefined rules
            and algorithms that lack the ability to think creatively and come up with new ideas and
            can result in repetitive or formulaic content, (c) AI Models can struggle with
            understanding the nuances of language, including slang, idioms, and cultural references,
            which can result in output that is out of context or does not make sense, (d) AI Models
            do not have emotions and cannot understand or convey emotions in the way humans can,
            which can result in output that lacks the empathy and emotion that humans are able to
            convey, (e) AI Models can perpetuate biases that are present in the data used to train
            them, which can result in output that is discriminatory or offensive, (f) AI Models can
            struggle with complex tasks that require reasoning, judgment and decision-making, (g) AI
            Models require large amounts of data to train and generate content, and the data used to
            train AI Models may be of poor quality or biased, which will negatively impact the
            accuracy and quality of the generated output, and (h) output can lack the personal touch
            that comes with content created by humans, which can make it seem cold and impersonal.
            You agree that you are responsible for evaluating, and bearing all risks associated
            with, the use of any content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or
            usefulness of Suggestions. ANY SUGGESTIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES

            15.4. <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Arbitration Procedures</span>.
            Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American
            Arbitration Association's (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer
            Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration
            Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,{' '}
            <a href="https://www.adr.org" className="text-black underline">
              https://www.adr.org

            AAA's consumer arbitration page,{' '}
            <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer" className="text-black underline">
              https://www.adr.org/consumer
            </a>
            . If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this
            Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control
            unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
            Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator
            must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the
            arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and
            arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are
            usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
            arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can
            award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator
            are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unless Aquila Labs and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in
            a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their
            ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree
            on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or
            less, Aquila Labs agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted
            solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
            hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim
            exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless
            of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a
            reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions
            on which the award is based.

            <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Arbitration Fees</span>") will be governed
            by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent
            any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Aquila Labs or you under
            the AAA Rules, Aquila Labs and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are
            able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your
            portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any
            reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees,
            Aquila Labs will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the
            arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
            litigation, Aquila Labs will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems
            necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of
            attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

            than the subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions
            and Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
            replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
            and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
            or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a
            court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above
            titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"
            are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be
            null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely
            with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will

            if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the

            16.1. <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">General Terms</span>. These Terms,
            including the Privacy Policy, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by
            reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
            between you and Aquila Labs regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or
            transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation
            of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms and
            all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your User Content, at
            any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision
            will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will
            a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms,
            be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use
            of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact
            on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word
            “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to
            be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the
            greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

            16.2. <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Governing Law</span>. These Terms
            are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law
            principles. All disputes and claims arising from these Terms will be governed in
            accordance with the arbitration provisions set forth above in Section 15; provided that
            you and Aquila Labs submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
            courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California for (a)
            individual claims brought in small claims court, (b) claims for injunctive or equitable
            relief, (c) claims involving infringement or violation of intellectual property rights,
            and (d) enforcement of any awards or relief provided following arbitration. We operate
            the Service from the United States, and we make no representation that Materials
