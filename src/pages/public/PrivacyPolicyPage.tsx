      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Personal information we collect</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        You may choose to interact with our Apps in ways that provide us with your personal
        information. In some instances, a User ID is generated for form and URL tracking, page
        views, page pings, and usage counts in order to ascertain product performance and
        development. The amount and type of information that Aquila Labs gathers depends on the
        nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to
        share. For example, we ask visitors who use our community Discord or forum to provide a
        username and email address. We will also collect the information you provide with us in
        connection with creating an account on the App. In each case, Aquila Labs collects such
        personal information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of
        your interaction with or your request to Aquila Labs. We will not disclose your personal
        information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.

        Like most website operators, Aquila Labs automatically collects (i) technical information

        language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 4G),
        and general location information such as city, state, or geographic area; and (ii)
        information about your visit to our Apps and online activity data (such as the referral URL,
        the content viewed, and the content interacted with). Some of this information is collected
        using cookies, web beacons, and related local storage technologies. See below for further
        information on these technologies. We collect this information to better understand how
        visitors use our Apps, to improve our Apps and experience for visitors, and to monitor the

        Aquila Labs may share your personal information with the third-parties listed below for the
        purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise with your consent.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Aquila Labs only shares your personal information with those of its employees, contractors,
        and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that personal information in order to
        process it on Aquila Labs' behalf or to provide services available on the App, and (ii) that
        have agreed not to disclose it to others.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Aquila Labs may disclose your personal information to professional advisors, such as
        lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional
        services that they render to us.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Aquila Labs may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our business or assets,
        including your personal information, in connection with a business transaction (or potential
        business transaction) such as a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition,
        reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy or dissolution. In such a
        case, we will make reasonable efforts to require the recipient to honor this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Service Providers and partners</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Aquila Labs engages a number of service providers or partners to manage or support certain
        aspects of our business operations on our behalf. For instance, we currently use the
        following service providers who will handle your personal information:

      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        <span className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Legal Requirements</span>. We may disclose
        personal information to government authorities or other third-parties if required to do so
        by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with a
        subpoena, court order or similar legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or
        property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of any App
        or the public, (d) protect against legal liability, (e) to investigate fraud or other

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Cross-border transfer of personal information</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        The Apps are hosted in the United States, and the personal information we collect will be
        stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors, and
        affiliated organizations that process information for us as described above may be located
        in the United States or in other countries outside of your home country, which may have
        different data protection standards from those that apply in your home country.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Where your personal information is transferred outside of the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK,
        and where this is to a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU
        Commission or considered adequate as determined by applicable data protection laws, we will
        take steps to ensure your personal information is adequately protected by safeguards such as
        Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) approved by the EU Commission or by the UK Government.

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Information we collect may be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with
        this Privacy Policy, but we understand that users from other countries may have different
        expectations and rights with regard to their privacy. For all App visitors and users, no
        matter their country of location, we will:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pl-6 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do collect your personal
          information and where required by applicable law;
        </li>
        <li>
          Only collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary for the purpose it is
          collected for, unless you choose to provide us with more;
        </li>
        <li>
          Offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting your information that we
          have collected, with the exception of information you voluntarily provide that is
          necessary to retain as is for the integrity of our project code as described further
          below; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide App users with notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit
          the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and
          enforcement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-gray-700">Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pl-6 text-gray-700">
        <li>
          Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent or a contract and the
          processing is carried out by automated means);
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent). If you ask to
          withdraw your consent, this will not affect any processing which has already taken place
          at that time;
        </li>
        <li>Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests);</li>
        <li>Right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes;</li>
        <li>
          Right of erasure of your personal data from our system (“right to be forgotten”) if
          certain grounds are met.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal
        information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are
        required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Where we collect personal information to administer your accounts or your contract with us,
        or to comply with our legal obligations, this is mandatory, and we will not be able to
        manage our relationship with you without this. In all other cases, the provision of
        requested personal information is optional, but this may affect your ability to participate
        in certain App-related activities or being able to access and use certain features and
        services, where the information is needed for those purposes.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Data retention and deletion</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        If you already have an account on the Apps, you may access, update, alter, or delete your
        basic user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Aquila Labs will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed
        to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the App, comply with
        legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.
        Retention periods will be determined by the type of information that is collected and the
        purpose for which it is collected, bearing in mind the requirements applicable to the
        situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused information at the earliest reasonable
        opportunity. For instance, in respect of data held for the management of customers and
        potential customers, we consider the lead time necessary to develop and maintain our
        commercial relationships and how recent our interactions are with you. We may rectify,
        update, or remove incomplete or inaccurate information at any time and at our own
        discretion. For more information on our retention periods, you can contact us using the
        details in the 'Contacting Aquila Labs About Your Privacy' section of this Privacy Policy.

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Please note that due to the open-source nature of our products, services, and community, we
        may retain limited personal information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional
        integrity and non-repudiation. For example, if you provide your information in connection
        with a blog post, GitHub issue, or comment, we may display that information even if you have
        deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.
